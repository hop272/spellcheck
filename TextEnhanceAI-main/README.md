# TextEnhanceAI - Editor with Local LLM Integration

TextEnhanceAI is a local desktop editor that uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to proofread, rewrite, translate, and improve text without sending it to a cloud service. Version 0.13 adds a structured review workflow so every suggestion can be accepted or rejected before it changes the document.

## Key features

- **Sentence-by-sentence review:** changed sentences are shown separately instead of combining red and green words in the editor.
- **Individual change groups:** expand a sentence to accept or reject specific word or punctuation changes.
- **Clear visual differences:** removed text is labeled and struck through; added text is labeled and underlined, so color is not the only indicator.
- **Visible decisions:** accepted and rejected states are bold green and red; pending and partially accepted states are bold blue and orange.
- **Safe application:** the source remains unchanged while suggestions are reviewed. Apply is enabled only after every change has a decision.
- **Undo:** restore the exact text from before the most recently applied review.
- **Cancellable local generation:** Ollama runs in the background, the editor stays responsive, and partial cancelled responses are discarded.
- **Editing modes:** Grammar, Proofread, Natural, Streamline, Awkward, Rewrite, Concise, Polish, Improve, Translate, and Custom.
- **Model status:** see whether Ollama is connected, unavailable, or missing a local model.
- **Markdown history:** each successful proposal, individual decision, and final result is logged to a local scratchpad.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Ollama installed and running
- At least one local Ollama model

Install the Python dependency:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Pull a model suited to your hardware:

- GPU with approximately 6–8 GB of VRAM: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
- CPU-only or lower-resource computer: `ollama pull qwen3:1.7b`

The app defaults to `llama3.1:8b`. Select another installed model from the Model dropdown or change the default with the `TEAI_MODEL` environment variable.

## Run the app

```powershell
python TextEnhanceAI.py
```

Using `uv` is also supported:

```powershell
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run python TextEnhanceAI.py
```

## Review workflow

1. Paste or type text in the editor.
2. Choose an editing mode and model.
3. Select **Review changes** or press `Ctrl+Enter`.
4. Review each changed sentence. Accept or reject the whole sentence, or expand **Review individual changes** for finer control.
5. Use **Previous** and **Next** to navigate.
6. Apply the reviewed text after no pending decisions remain.

Keyboard shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+Enter`: generate suggestions or apply a completed review
- `Alt+A`: accept the current sentence
- `Alt+R`: reject the current sentence
- `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right`: previous or next suggestion

Generated `TextEnhanceAI-scratchpad_*.md` files are stored next to the application and ignored by Git.

## Development and tests

The launcher remains `TextEnhanceAI.py`. Pure editing logic and Ollama access live in `core/`, while Tkinter screens live in `ui/`.

Install test dependencies and run the suite:

```powershell
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uv run pytest -q
```

The automated suite uses fake Ollama responses and does not require a running model. Version 0.13 is verified with Ollama Python client 0.6.1; a live Ollama smoke test is still recommended for release verification.
